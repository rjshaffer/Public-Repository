The ancestors simulation compares ancestral population size to total population size for a reproductively isolated species using probabilistic modeling. The user selects the the following values:

* seed population size
* number of generations
* population carrying capacity
* population growth rate
* mating system (polygamous, monogamous, or monogamous with ancestor separation)
* resource depletion (carrying capacity diminishes as resources are exhausted, yes or no)

Results are plotted and compared to mathematically predicted values.

Note, ancestors is a portable, standalone, Windows application that does not need to be installed and will not make changes to your system configuration. Simply download the zip file, right click, and "extract all" in any folder. Open the resulting ancestors folder and double click on "start.exe".
